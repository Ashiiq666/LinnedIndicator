# LinnedIndicator
Introducing the "Dynamic Line Indicator" for Android, a versatile UI component that enhances user experience in ViewPager and RecyclerView-based applications. This open-source library simplifies navigation and progression cues for users. As the number of items in your ViewPager or RecyclerView increases, the Dynamic Line Indicator seamlessly adjusts the size of its indicators, ensuring an elegant and space-efficient representation of the user's current position within the content.

Special thanks to the external library "com.github.zhpanvip:viewpagerindicator:1.2.3" for making this implementation possible. It has played a crucial role in creating a seamless and dynamic user interface element. Customization options allow developers to tailor the indicator to match their app's unique style, making it a valuable addition to onboarding flows, image galleries, content carousels, or any scenario requiring step-based navigation.

With a user-friendly repository, comprehensive documentation, and an open-source license, the Dynamic Line Indicator is a valuable resource for developers looking to improve the user experience of their Android applications.
